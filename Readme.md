## F.A.Qs

### Q. How do I import this framework to my project?

Download [the library](TBD) and add the following depedency in your module's `gradle.build` file:

````kotlin
dependencies {
  	implementation files('<the-downloaded-aar-file-path>/findsurface.aar')
}
````

And then, click the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" button on the top left corner of the Android Studio.

That's it. You're all set to go.



### Q. Does this framework work on Android Native/NDK?

You have to directly use the header files and the .so file embedded in the provided aar file in order to link the native side. If your app has both native part (c/c++) and Java/Kotlin part, use the aar file when you build the app. Details on the steps will be updated in the future.
